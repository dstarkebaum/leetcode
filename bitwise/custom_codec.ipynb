    "- Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The encoded string should be **as compact as possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.\n",

    "- The basic approach is to parse the BST in \"pre-order\" fashion: root, left, right\n",
    "\n",
    "- To accomplish this parsing, the following 4 steps are repeated until the whole tree is traversed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. each node is added to a stack (for backtracking down the right path later)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. The value stored in each node is added to a \"results\" list as the tree is parsed\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Keep going down the left branch (collecting values along the way), until you run out of nodes\n",
    "  \n",
    "  4. Then backtrack to the last non-null node, and go one step down the right path\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Once the tree traversal is completed, the values are all converted into strings for serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: to make the serialized string \"as compact as possible\", a compression algorithm is applied to the integers as they are encoded into strings\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Instead of just storing the numbers in decimal format [0-9], a custom alphabet is used for encoding. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The default alphabet includes the numerical digits, along with all letters [A-Z] and [a-z], giving a base 62 encoding\n",
    "    \n",
    "  - Negative numbers are handled with a leading '-' sign\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Modular division is used to convert the integer into the encoding string, with the remainder of each modular division step translated into one of the characters in codec.ALPHABET\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The string order is reversed so that it could be \"readable\" from left to right (as most numbers are). This step could be skipped for a bit more optimization if desired...\n",

    "  - NOTE: A custom alphabet may be defined as an optional argument when constructing the serialization codec\n",
